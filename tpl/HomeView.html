            <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.</p>

        <h2>Try It</h2>

        <p>Enter a few characters in the Search Box in the upper right corner of the screen, and select an employee. In
            the Employee view, you can navigate up and down the Org Chart by clicking either the Manager link,
            or one of the Direct Reports in the sidebar on the right of the screen.</p>

        <h2>Get Help</h2>
        <p>The Employee Directory use case is simple enough to be easily understandable. It's also not entirely trivial and provides a good playground to test frameworks in a real-life context. Other versions of the application built with other frameworks are available on the author's blog.<p>
